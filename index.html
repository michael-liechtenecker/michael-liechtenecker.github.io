            <h3>Michael Otto Liechtenecker</h3>
            <p>A newcomer to the software engineering profession. Self taught and always willing to learn new, exciting skills to challenge myself and become even better.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>Why?</h4>
         <p>Because working an ordinary job was not enough. I wanted to be able to use my mind to create, improve and optimize things. Finding solutions for complex problems and creatively adapting to new situatons is what i seek for in this way.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>How?</h4>
            <p>By learning to code! It started out of pure curiosity whyle on a deployment abroad and ended in myself diving deeper into the world of software engineering.</p>
            <p>I started by taking a C++ - fundamentals course online and continued with the "full stack web development" course, currently specialising in front end technologies.</p>
            <p>And besides taking those courses it was and still is important to me to keep learning and continually improving my skills. Look at <a href="https://michael-liechtenecker.github.io/projects">Projects</a> if you want to see a few examples of my continuous work with training and personal projects.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h4>What comes next?</h4>
            <p>While still making progress in the classic "web2" development genre i plan on diving in in blockchain technology and keep up with the newest technology while always practicing and improving on all my skills collected on my journey. Accompanying to this my goal is to soon land a job in software engineering to be able to connect this newly dicovered passion of mine with a well suited job for me. This way i hope to learn through working and both me and my employer will be able to profit.</p>
